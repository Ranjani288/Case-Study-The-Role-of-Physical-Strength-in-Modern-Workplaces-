# Case-Study-The-Role-of-Physical-Strength-in-Modern-Workplaces-
In today's high-tech world, the relevance of physical strength in various professional domains 
remains an open question. While cognitive skills and computer-related abilities are highly 
valued, there are significant occupations that require both cognitive aptitude and substantial 
physical prowess. 
This raises the question: Does physical strength have a measurable impact on job performance 
in physically demanding professions such as construction work, electrical work, and auto 
mechanics? Furthermore, statisticians face the challenge of developing an effective measure of 
physical ability that can efficiently and reliably assess candidates for physically demanding 
roles without risking injury.
Can statistical analysis provide insights into the relationship between physical strength and job 
performance and aid in the selection process for physically demanding jobs? 
Can statistical procedures validate a measure of physical ability that can be utilized during 
candidate selection, ensuring efficient and safe evaluations? 
The data collected in this case study involved 560 individuals working in physically demanding 
jobs. The participants' strength data were summarized into "grip" and "arm" scores. In addition, 
job performance was assessed using two measures: ratings provided by supervisors on the 
physical aspects of the participants' jobs, and scores obtained from simulations of physically 
demanding work tasks, referred to as "sims." All variables are numeric. The data analysis aimed 
to explore the relationship between these measures of strength and performance.
